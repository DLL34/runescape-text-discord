# runescape-text
Generates a gif of text based on runescape chatbox effects

If you long for the days of selling your rune scimmy:

`python runescape.py wave:glow1:This will generate a convincing replica`

The Discord bot will parse messages in all channels it is in, and upload a gif of the runescape text in response to the message. To invoke, use the same format as above but prepend `rs:`:

`rs:wave2:glow1:Like this`
